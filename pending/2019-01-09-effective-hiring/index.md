The developer/engineer hiring process is incredibly ineffective and inefficient.

<!-- end -->

**Preface:** I write this, a little frustrated, after roughly sixteen days with as many interviews. I'm employeed full time currently but I'm also interested in finding new opportunities and not losing my interview skillz. But I'm finding the more I interview the more I see the whole process of hiring developers as ineffective and inefficient.

In the past week I've spent more time working on projects that are just going to be thrown away than I have working on the actual products I maintain.

As a senior developer at a small startup I'm no stranger to the hiring process. The résumé screening. The phone call screening. The technical assessment. The "I don't think this is a good idea". All of it. Yet, the more I perform any of them on the receiving or giving ends the more problems I see with the whole process.

# What are the problems?

It's difficult to nail down. The biggest is probably coming up with a solution to the question: **Do I know you?**

The easiest answer is, no I don't know you. Then as people in a hiring position we come up with all these steps that define a process that answers this question. In order to know you I need to validate that the information you are giving me is accurate. That you are who you say you are and that you can perform the tasks that the position demands. Which creates the other question: **Can you do the job?**

Maybe you can do the job and maybe this information you've given me is 100% truthful. As someone in a position of power and respect by colleagues where I'm employeed I've been tasked with figuring out a solution to this answer. So I look at the job requirements and build out a series of questions, a test, or a project so that then I can ask the question: \*\*Can you
