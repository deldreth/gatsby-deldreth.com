In the fast paced world of modern software development it's easy to feel like you need to know a bit of everything. People are often afraid to admit that they don't know something.

While knowledge is great, speciality is great too. Here's a small list of things I don't know as of 2019. Obviously these are all technology/development related. A list of everything I don't know would be enormous.

### MySQL (SQL in general)
I'm comfortable and proficient with working in and around SQL. However, I've never committed any of it to memory. I can't recite the difference between a create, select, insert, or update statement without looking it up. Basically, if I need to deal with SQL I'm going to be referencing the docs.

### Test Driven Development
I get asked about this a lot. And I always have the same basic follow up question: "How's that working out for you?" I have yet to receive a good answer. At this point in my career I don't actually know how anyone could effectively write a test before writing a draft. Unless the scope is overly simple. It seems like a big waste of time and just something that someone would shout at a potential investor: "YEAH WE'RE AGILE, TDD!"

### Why Statically Typed Javascript is Important
I use Typescript a lot and before that I used flow. I get the premise of type safety and using it as a first line of error prevention. Outside of the occasional "Oh yeah I meant to use that here" and then just fix the problem... I can't really justify the overhead of moving to a statically typed situation.
